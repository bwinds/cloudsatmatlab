cloudsatmatlab
==============
This repository contains code that allows robust reading of CloudSat files.

To install, simply move the +cloudsat folder into your main MATLAB directory, ensuring the plus sign is retained in the directory name.

Reading a file simply requires calling the cloudsat.read function with appropriate variables.

Versions successfully tested on include R2011b, R2014a, and R2014b. Please feel free to contact me with other compatibilities at ethan-nelson@users.noreply.github.com or directly on GitHub.
